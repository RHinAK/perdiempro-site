    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: June 15, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of PerDiem ProStats ("the App"), developed by Rodney Hughey ("we", "our", "us"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Use of the App</h2>
    <p>PerDiem ProStats is a personal finance and travel expense tracking tool. The App is provided for informational and organizational purposes only. You are responsible for verifying the accuracy of any per diem rates, tax calculations, or expense data before relying on them for official, legal, or tax purposes.</p>

    <h2>Not Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>The App is not a substitute for professional tax, financial, or legal advice. GSA per diem rates displayed in the App are sourced from publicly available government data and may not reflect the most current rates. Tax calculations are estimates only. Always consult a qualified tax professional or accountant for decisions affecting your tax filings or financial obligations.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional auto-renewing subscriptions to unlock Pro features. Subscriptions are managed through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
        <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your App Store account settings.</li>
        <li>Any unused portion of a free trial period is forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your data. You are solely responsible for backing up your data. Deleting the App will permanently remove all locally stored data including trips, expenses, receipts, and reports.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Rodney Hughey and are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer the App.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components. We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy or completeness of GSA per diem rate data or any calculations provided by the App.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to errors in per diem rates, tax calculations, or data loss resulting from device failure or app deletion.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
