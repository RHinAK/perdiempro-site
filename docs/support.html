    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What are GSA per diem rates?</strong>
        <p>GSA (General Services Administration) per diem rates are the maximum daily allowances the federal government sets for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses when traveling on official business. Many private employers also use GSA rates as a benchmark for their own travel reimbursement policies. PerDiem ProStats lets you look up these rates by location so you always know what your allowance covers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I track my per diem?</strong>
        <p>Create a trip with your destination and travel dates. PerDiem ProStats will look up the applicable GSA per diem rates for that location. Then log your actual expenses each day — meals, lodging, transportation, incidentals. The app will show you a real-time comparison of your per diem allowance vs. what you've actually spent, so you can see exactly how much you're saving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How does receipt scanning work?</strong>
        <p>When adding an expense, tap the camera icon to snap a photo of your receipt, or choose an existing image from your photo library. The receipt photo is attached to that expense and stored locally on your device. This gives you a complete digital record for reimbursement claims or tax documentation — no more shoeboxes full of paper receipts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I generate an expense report?</strong>
        <p>Go to the Reports tab and select a trip. PerDiem ProStats will generate a detailed expense report showing all your daily expenses, receipt photos, per diem vs. actual spending breakdowns, and trip totals. You can export the report as a PDF and share it via email, AirDrop, or any other iOS sharing method — perfect for submitting to your employer or accountant.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Is my data private?</strong>
        <p>Yes. All your data is stored locally on your device. We don't have servers, we don't collect your data, and we never sell anything to anyone. Your trips, expenses, receipts, and reports stay on your iPhone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What does the Pro subscription include?</strong>
        <p>PerDiem ProStats is free to download with core expense tracking included.

    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I cancel my subscription?</strong>
        <p>Go to Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions on your iPhone, find PerDiem ProStats, and tap Cancel Subscription. You'll keep Pro access until the end of your current billing period.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>I'm not seeing my subscription / features are locked</strong>
        <p>Try these steps: (1) Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID you used to subscribe. (2) Go to the "More" tab and tap "Restore Purchases." (3) Restart the app. If it still doesn't work, contact us at the email below.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What happens if I delete the app?</strong>
        <p>Your data is stored locally, so deleting the app will remove your data. We strongly recommend exporting your expense reports as PDFs before uninstalling so you have a backup of your records.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Why does the app need my location?</strong>
        <p>Location access is optional and used only to look up GSA per diem rates for your current area. You can always enter a location manually instead. Your location data is never stored or transmitted.</p>
