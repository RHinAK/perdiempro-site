    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: June 15, 2026</p>

    <p>PerDiem ProStats ("the App") is developed by Rodney Hughey ("we", "our", "us"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on our servers.</strong> All data you enter into the App — including trips, daily expenses, receipts, mileage records, and expense reports — is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. We have no servers and no way to access your data.</p>

    <h2>Camera Access</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may access your device camera to capture photos of receipts. These photos are stored locally on your device as part of your expense records. We do not upload, transmit, or access your photos in any way.</p>

    <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may access your photo library so you can attach existing receipt images to expenses. Selected images are copied into the App's local storage on your device. We do not access, upload, or transmit your photo library contents.</p>

    <h2>Location Access</h2>
    <p>With your explicit permission, the App may access your device location to look up GSA per diem rates for your current area. Your location data is used on-device only to determine the applicable per diem rates and is not stored, transmitted, or shared with any third party.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional subscriptions managed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or process any payment information. All subscription transactions are handled by Apple. Please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how Apple handles your purchase data.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. We do not collect usage data, crash reports, or device information.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose your data to any third parties. Period.</p>

    <h2>Data Export</h2>
    <p>The App provides features to export your expense reports as PDF files. These exports are generated locally on your device and shared using the standard iOS share sheet. We do not receive copies of your exported data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
